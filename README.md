# decam_ddf_tools
Tools for analyzing the DECam DDF program data.

## Python notebooks:

basics_COSMOS.ipynb : answers a few basics questions about the extragalactic field data-- how many objects and candidates were detected, how objects are distributed among candidates, and how those distributions change when an R/B cutoff is applied.

sources_per_image_COSMOS.ipynb : looks at how many "good" (R/B > 0.6) objects are found per extragalactic field image, and at how a candidate's average R/B score is correlated to the number of times it is detected.

weather_sky_moon_COSMOS.ipynb : examines correlations between sky factors (moon distance, moon illumination, seeing, and zero-point magnitude) and the number of "good" (R/B > 0.6) object detections per exposure.

SNsearch.ipynb : The purpose of this notebook is to search through the extragalactic field to identify candidates that are likely supernovae. This is done by selecting every candidate that has at least X detections over at least Y days, with a change of at least Z mag, and that doesn't increase in brightness more than once

SNIasearch.ipynb : Essentially the same as SNsearch.ipynb, but it requires that (after peak r brightness) rmag < gmag in an effort to identify specifically type Ia SNe.

fastrisers.ipynb : This notebook searches the extragalactic fields for candidates that (on their first night of detection) rose monotonically by at least X mag over at least Y detections in the same night.

RB.ipynb : This notebook looks for correlations between the legitimacy of candidates and the RB scores of their candidates

## Modules:

decam_utils.py : Useful functions for exploring our data. Currently contains:

plotlc(), a function that makes a lightcurve for a chosen candidate

rm_dupes(), a function that removes duplicate rows from arrays

pull_exptimes(), a function that updates fnm_exptime.txt

## .txt files:

moondata.txt : generated by MLG, columns are (respectively) the archive filename base, the moon separation (in degrees), and the moon illumination (as a fraction). Only contains nonzero values for observations that were obtained with a <60 deg separation from the moon and when the moon illumination fraction was >0.2

medpixval.txt : generated by MLG, columns are (respectively) the archive filename base and the median pixel value (in counts)

archive_image_list.txt : generated by MLG using NoirLab database, contains a bunch of metadata for DDF observations

fnm_exptime : A table of filenames and exposure times, generated using the decam_utils.pull_exptimes() function (which pulls from Rob's database)
