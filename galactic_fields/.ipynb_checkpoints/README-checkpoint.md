# decam_ddf_tools / galactic_fields
Tools for analyzing the DECam DDF program data for the galactic fields, DECaPS-East and DECaPS-West.

The contents of this directory remain under construction.

Note:

 * "object" refers to a single detection in a difference image
 * "candidate" refers to associated detections at a given sky location
 * "probably-real" candidates means >10 detections, mean R/B>0.4
   * cuts shown to be reasonable in `source_detection_summary_figures.ipynb/`
   * cuts also discussed in Section 3 of Graham et al. (in prep)
