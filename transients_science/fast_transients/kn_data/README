This tarball contains data and data-derived models from the paper:

"The Electromagnetic Counterpart of the Binary Neutron Star Merger LIGO/VIRGO GW170817. II. UV, Optical, and Near-infrared Light Curves and Comparison to Kilonova Models" by Cowperthwaite, P. S. et al

The tarball contains the following files:

### RAW PHOTOMETRY DATA ###
decam_photometry.csv - A CSV file of all DECam photometry used in this work. This photometry is NOT corrected for reddening nor extinction.

The columns are:
mjd - MJD Date of observation
band - Bandpass of observation
flux - Measured difference flux 
dflux - Error in measured difference flux
mag - AB magnitude from -2.5log10(flux) + zpt
dmag - Random error in AB magnitude
snr - Signal-to-noise ratio of detection
zpt - Derived supercal zeropoint from PS1->DECam (AB Magnitudes)
dzpt - Systematic error in zeropoint determination

gemini_photometry.csv - A CSV File of all Gemini-South/FLAMINGOS2 photometry used in this work. This photometry is NOT corrected for reddending nor extinction

The columns are:
mjd - MJD Date of observation
band - Bandpass of observation
flux - Calibrated flux from 10^(-0.4 * (mag - zpt)), zpt = 30 
dflux - Error in calibrated flux
mag - AB magnitudes
dmag - Random error in AB magnitude
snr - Signal-to-noise ratio of detection

### MODEL DATA ###

General Notes:
[1] The model magnitudes are fit against extinction corrected photometry. The extinction correction values in magnitudes, for E(B-V) = 0.105, are:

DECam Filters:
{'u' : 0.42,
 'g' : 0.33,
 'r' : 0.22,
 'i' : 0.16,
 'z' : 0.12,
 'Y' : 0.11}

GEMINI Filters:
{'H'  : 0.06,
 'Ks' : 0.04}

[2] The model timesteps are nonuniform due to an output issue with Mosfit. Do not use under the assumption of uniform time sampling.

[3] All model files have the same CSV/column structure:

time - time since explosion/merger
mjd - model time in MJD for direct comparison to light curves
band - bandpass 
mag - model magnitude (extinction corrected)

The complete list of model data files is:
