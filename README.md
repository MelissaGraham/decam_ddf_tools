# decam_ddf_tools
Tools for analyzing the DECam DDF program data.

To use the nightly-epoch lightcurves for probably-real candidates in the extragalactic fields (COSMOS and ELAIS), look in the `extragalactic_fields/science_with_candidates/` directory.

Note:

 * "object" refers to a single detection in a difference image
 * "candidate" refers to associated detections at a given sky location
 * "probably-real" candidates means >10 detections, mean R/B>0.4
   * cuts shown to be reasonable in `source_detection_summary_figures.ipynb/`
   * cuts also discussed in Section 3 of Graham et al. (in prep)


## Files:

archive_image_list.txt : generated by MLG using NOIRLab's DataLab to access DECam images from archive; contains a bunch of metadata for DDF images (RA, Dec, MJD, filter, airmass, target, exposure time, sequence ID, image type classification, moon separation, moon illumination, estimate of sky background in counts)
